Hi Team,

I am new to AWS and I just started learning/exploring resources of different services available on aws. Since I am not aware of the charges for the uses of resources and I am still under learning of services,I would request to waive off  the bill since I can not afford to pay now.

I will make sure that I am utilizing the services and its resources judiciously in future. 

Thanks,
